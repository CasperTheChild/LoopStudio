## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap framework
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass preprocessor

### What I Learned

I've tried using the Sass preprocessor for the first time. However, I don't see any benefits since I am already using Bootstrap.

### Continued Development

I'll keep practicing the Sass preprocessor.
